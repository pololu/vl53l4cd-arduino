provided provided by ST (STSW-IMG026), and some of the explanatory comments are
quoted or paraphrased from the API source code, API user manual (UM2931), and
VL53L4CD datasheet. Therefore, the license terms for the API source code (BSD
3-Clause Clear License) also apply to this derivative work, as specified below.
